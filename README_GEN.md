## 1. Description<a name="desc"></a>
The purpose of this project is to automate the process of generation and formatting of high-quality ReadMe file. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## 2. Installation<a name="inst"></a>
To make this application work, the user must interact with the program using the CLI in a node environment. The first step is to install an inquirer package that is used to prompt the user for their input. Another package, fs, used to construct the file for the user, is already integrated. To install the inquirer, the user needs to run [ npm install inquirer --save ]. After that, the user can launch the CLI based application from the integrated terminal running the command [ node index.js ].

## 3. Usage<a name="usage"></a>
The user is prompted with the series of questions to provide the information on the project description, installation requirements, usage, contribution, reporting the issues, licenses used. All the answers, besides licences are provided as a text input. Licence information is selected from the available list of licenses.
